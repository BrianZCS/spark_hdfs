* Part 2: A simple Spark application

* Part 3: PageRank
- Task 1. Write a Scala/Python/Java Spark application that implements the PageRank algorithm.
- Task 2. In order to achieve high parallelism, Spark will split the data into smaller chunks called partitions which are distributed across different nodes in the cluster. 
- Task 3. Persist the appropriate DataFrame/RDD(s) as in-memory objects and see what changes.
- Task 4. Kill a Worker process and see the changes.
