Use the run.sh to run the task3. The program reads bunch of wiki data from HDFS and runs a pageRank program and output the final ranking to HDFS.

We used the persist to change the storage level of the dataframe. 
Example: ranks = ranks.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY)

How to Run:
spark-3.3.4-bin-hadoop3/bin/spark-submit pageRank_wiki_memory.py
